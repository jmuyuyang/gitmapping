  "readme": "# Typr :: Mutually Exclusive JS Type Testring [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clux/typr.png)](http://travis-ci.org/clux/typr)\n\nThe aim of this module is to completely partition the set of JS objects into a set of types T:\n\n````\nT = [Function, Object, Date, Number, String, Boolean, RegExp, Undefined, Arguments, Null, Array]\n````\n\n*Prop. 1* For every JS object x, x has exactly one type in T where [typr] returns true for its typecheck.\n\n*Prop. 2* Whether or not an Object has keys and can be looped over is determined by `t.hasKeys` and is completely independent of the type found in prop 1.\n\n*Prop. 3* Number types can be partitioned into 3 sub-types:\n\n- isNaN\n- isInfinite\n- isNumeric i.e. !isNaN && !isInfinite\n\n\nThese properties are tested extensively.\n\n## Usage\nBasic usage:\n\n````javascript\nvar typr = require('typr');\ntypr.isFunction(el); // true iff el is a function\n````\n\nRead the very short [API](https://github.com/clux/typr/master/api.md).\n\n### Object Keys\nThe reason for prop 2 is that Objects can masquerade othes instances like\nFunctions, Strings, RegExps, Dates. Object.keys() (and for-in) will actually work on some\nof these. This does not mean they will have interesting keys, but they sometimes\ndo!\n\nA common trick in node modules to export a function, but additionally attach\nproperties to it. Such an object will only be a Function by our partitioning\n(as that was its original construction), but it is Object-like.\n\nIf you would rather test for enumerability of properties, use the extra test for Object-likeness: `hasKeys`.\n\nNote again that this may not be super intuitive:\n\n````javascript\nvar dualThing = new String(\"wee\");\ndualThing.prop = \"hi\";\nObject.keys(dualThing); // [ '0', '1', '2', 'prop' ]\n\nt.isObject(dualThing); // false\nt.isString(dualThing); // true\nt.hasKeys(dualThing); // true\n````\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install typr\n```\n\n## Running tests\nInstall development dependencies\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nRun the tests\n\n```bash\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## License\nMIT-Licensed.
